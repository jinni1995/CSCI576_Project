## Installation

To install this project, complete the following steps. These steps assume Python 3
is already installed on your system.

1.  Download the inputs from the CSCI 576 DEN website. Unzip these into the `input` folder.
    The input folder should have a `project_dataset` folder within it.

2.  Create a new Python 3 virtual environment. On MacOS, the command for that is this:
    `python3 -m venv venv`

3.  Activate the virtual environment. On MacOS, the command is this:
    `source ./venv/bin/activate`

Note - to deactivate, simply type `deativate`

4.  Install the required python modules with the command `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Running

To run this project, ensure that `my_program.py` is executable. On MacOS, this is
done by running `chmod +x my_program.py`.

After that, simply run the `my_program.py` script. On MacOS, this is done by running `./my_program.py`.
